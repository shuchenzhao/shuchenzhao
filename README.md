### Hi there 👋

- 🤗 I majored in software engineering in college, and specifically chose web front-end as my career direction.
- 👩🏻‍💻 Technology stack: Mainly JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Vue/Webpack/Node.js ...
- 👀 Currently I am also learning new skills such as Vite/Sass and Mobile development.

I don't commit often because I'm not currently maintaining any open source project. 

You can also find me on Gitee. I did some small projects with my classmates a while back. Here's the address: https://gitee.com/zhao_shuchen
